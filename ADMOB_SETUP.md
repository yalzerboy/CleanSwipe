# AdMob Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented AdMob integration to replace the placeholder advertisements in your CleanSwipe app. The implementation includes:

- **AdMobManager**: A comprehensive manager for handling interstitial ads and rewarded ads
- **Updated Ad Views**: Replaced placeholder ad views with real AdMob implementations
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Loading States**: User-friendly loading indicators

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. AdMobManager.swift
- Singleton manager for all ad operations
- Handles interstitial ads and rewarded ads
- Automatic ad reloading after display
- Error handling and state management
- Test ad unit IDs (ready for production replacement)

### 2. Updated Ad Views
- **AdModalView**: Now shows real interstitial ads with loading states
- **RewardedAdModalView**: Now shows real rewarded ads with proper reward handling
- Both views include retry functionality and error display

### 3. Info.plist Configuration
- Added GADApplicationIdentifier (test ID)
- Added SKAdNetworkItems for iOS 14+ privacy compliance

## Next Steps to Complete Integration

### 1. Add Google Mobile Ads SDK (REQUIRED)
You need to add the Google Mobile Ads SDK to your Xcode project:

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Go to **File** â†’ **Add Package Dependencies**
3. Enter the URL: `https://github.com/googleads/swift-package-manager-google-mobile-ads`
4. Click **Add Package**
5. Select your main app target (CleanSwipe)
6. Click **Add Package**

**Note**: The current build will fail until you add this SDK because the code references `import GoogleMobileAds`.

### 2. Replace Test Ad Unit IDs
In `AdMobManager.swift`, replace the test ad unit IDs with your real ones:

```swift
// Replace these test IDs with your real AdMob ad unit IDs
private let interstitialAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-4682463617947690/7651841807" // Test ID
private let rewardedAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-4682463617947690/9478879047" // Test ID
```

### 3. Update Info.plist
Replace the test GADApplicationIdentifier in `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~1458002511</string> <!-- Replace with your real app ID -->
```

### 4. Get Real Ad Unit IDs
1. Go to [AdMob Console](https://admob.google.com/)
2. Create a new app or select existing app
3. Create ad units for:
   - Interstitial ads
   - Rewarded ads
4. Copy the ad unit IDs and replace the test IDs

## Features Implemented

### Interstitial Ads
- Load automatically when needed
- Show full-screen ads between app screens
- Automatic reloading after display
- Error handling with retry option

### Rewarded Ads
- Load automatically when needed
- Show video ads for user rewards (50 swipes)
- Proper reward verification
- Automatic reloading after display



## Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Ad loading failures
- Ad display failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms

## Testing
The current implementation uses Google's test ad unit IDs, so you can test the integration immediately. Test ads will show real ad content but won't generate revenue.

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Add Google Mobile Ads SDK to project
- [ ] Replace test ad unit IDs with real ones
- [ ] Replace test app ID with real one
- [ ] Test on real devices
- [ ] Verify ad compliance with App Store guidelines
- [ ] Set up ad content filtering if needed

## Notes
- The implementation is designed to work seamlessly with your existing subscription system
- Ads will only show to non-subscribers (as per your current logic)
- All ad loading is handled asynchronously to maintain app performance
- The implementation follows AdMob best practices and guidelines
