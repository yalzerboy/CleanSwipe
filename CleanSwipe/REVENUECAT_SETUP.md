   - **Bundle ID**: `com.yourcompany.cleanswipe` (or your actual bundle ID)

### 3. Create Subscription Product

   - **Product ID**: `cleanswipe_weekly_trial`
   - **Subscription Duration**: 1 week
   - **Free Trial**: 3 days
   - **Price**: Â£0.99/week (or your preferred price)

private let revenueCatAPIKey = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 6. Update PurchaseManager.swift

Uncomment the RevenueCat code and remove the simulation code:

```swift
import RevenueCat  // Uncomment this line

// In the configure() method, uncomment:
Purchases.logLevel = .debug
Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: revenueCatAPIKey)
Purchases.shared.delegate = self

// Uncomment all the TODO sections and remove simulation methods
```

### 7. Add App Store Configuration

Add to your app's `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
<false/>
```
