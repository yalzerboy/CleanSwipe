# Bug Fix Summary

## Bug Found: Incorrect Rewarded Swipes Implementation

### Issue Description
The `grantRewardedSwipes` function in `PurchaseManager.swift` had a critical bug where it was subtracting the reward count from `dailySwipeCount` instead of properly tracking rewarded swipes separately.

### Location
- **File**: `CleanSwipe/Managers/PurchaseManager.swift`
- **Function**: `grantRewardedSwipes(_ count: Int)`
- **Line**: 259 (original)

### Problem
```swift
// BUGGY CODE:
func grantRewardedSwipes(_ count: Int) {
    dailySwipeCount -= count // This is wrong!
    saveDailySwipeCount()
    updateCanSwipeStatus()
    print("üéÅ Rewarded \(count) swipes, new total: \(dailySwipeCount)")
}
```

**Issues with this approach:**
1. **Negative Values**: If `dailySwipeCount` is 10 (at limit) and 50 swipes are rewarded, it becomes -40
2. **Logic Confusion**: The daily limit check `dailySwipeCount < maxDailySwipes` would always pass with negative values
3. **Poor UX**: Users couldn't see how many bonus swipes they had remaining

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Added Separate Rewarded Swipes Tracking
- Added `@Published var rewardedSwipesRemaining: Int = 0` to track bonus swipes
- Added persistence methods `loadRewardedSwipes()` and `saveRewardedSwipes()`
- Rewarded swipes reset daily like regular swipes

#### 2. Fixed Swipe Recording Logic
```swift
func recordSwipe() {
    // Use rewarded swipes first, then daily swipes
    if rewardedSwipesRemaining > 0 {
        rewardedSwipesRemaining -= 1
        saveRewardedSwipes()
    } else {
        dailySwipeCount += 1
        saveDailySwipeCount()
    }
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

#### 3. Updated Swipe Availability Logic
```swift
private func updateCanSwipeStatus() {
    switch subscriptionStatus {
    case .trial, .active:
        canSwipe = true
    case .notSubscribed, .expired, .cancelled:
        canSwipe = rewardedSwipesRemaining > 0 || dailySwipeCount < maxDailySwipes
    }
}
```

#### 4. Enhanced UI Display
- Updated swipe counter to show `dailyUsed/totalAvailable` format
- Added bonus swipe indicator in the toolbar
- Added bonus swipe display in the limit reached screen

### Benefits of the Fix
1. **Correct Logic**: Rewarded swipes now work as intended
2. **Better UX**: Users can see their bonus swipes clearly
3. **Proper Tracking**: Daily and rewarded swipes are tracked separately
4. **Persistence**: Bonus swipes are saved and restored correctly
5. **Debug Support**: Debug functions updated to handle both swipe types

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test rewarded ad flow grants 50 swipes correctly
2. Verify swipes are consumed in correct order (bonus first, then daily)
3. Check that UI updates properly show bonus swipes
4. Ensure daily reset works for both swipe types
5. Test edge cases like multiple reward grants in one day
